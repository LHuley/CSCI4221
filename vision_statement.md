Vision Statement:

For citizen and homeowner of all kinds, managing what foods your store and consume can be a small yet tedious task. We would like to provide a way for people to keep track of what food they have, how much they have, whether the food is expired or not, and form recipes where they can make the requirements by measures and amounts with our smart refrigerator and app software. Unlike other smart refrigerators where the digital components have a relatively shorter lifespan and lack of cybersecurity, our product will last for longer periods of time and will be fitted out with high-end encryption protocols. Our product is crafted for everyday home or placeowners for the goal of adding structure to an everyday routine.
